SarcaPack - Simple and beautiful Minecraft resource pack

For the artists: Keep these in mind.
- Simple yet complex: Most textures are made with geometric shapes. The textures should remain simple and uncluttered, but not bland and boring.
- Part and whole: Textures should look beautiful as a part and as a whole.
- Friendly to all: Make sure the pack is friendly to the eyes, and for low-spec computers that can't display complex block models.
- Staying working: Never upload broken textures, or textures that look out of place when used at SarcaCraft (mc.sarc.biz). If you want to change up some textures to the point they will look out of place or will not play along well at SarcaCraft, create your own fork of the pack.
